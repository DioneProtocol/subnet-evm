# Subnet EVM

[Avalanche](https://docs.avax.network/learn/platform-overview) is a network composed of multiple blockchains.
Each blockchain is an instance of a Virtual Machine (VM), much like an object in an object-oriented language is an instance of a class.
That is, the VM defines the behavior of the blockchain.

Subnet EVM is the [Virtual Machine (VM)](https://docs.avax.network/learn/platform-overview#virtual-machines) that defines the Subnet Contract Chains. Subnet EVM is a simplified version of [Coreth VM (C-Chain)](https://github.com/ava-labs/coreth).

This chain implements the Ethereum Virtual Machine and supports Solidity smart contracts as well as most other Ethereum client functionality.

## Building

The Subnet EVM runs in a separate process from the main AvalancheGo process and communicates with it over a local gRPC connection.

## API

The Subnet EVM supports the following API namespaces:

- `eth`
- `personal`
- `txpool`
- `debug`

Only the `eth` namespace is enabled by default.
Full documentation for the C-Chain's API can be found [here.](https://docs.avax.network/build/avalanchego-apis/contract-chain-c-chain-api)

## Compatibility

The Subnet EVM is compatible with almost all Ethereum tooling, including [Remix,](https://docs.avax.network/build/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-a-smart-contract-on-avalanche-using-remix-and-metamask) [Metamask](https://docs.avax.network/build/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-a-smart-contract-on-avalanche-using-remix-and-metamask) and [Truffle.](https://docs.avax.network/build/tutorials/smart-contracts/using-truffle-with-the-avalanche-c-chain)

## Differences Between Subnet EVM and Coreth

- Added configurable fees and gas limits in genesis
- Merged Avalanche hardforks into the single "Subnet EVM" hardfork
- Removed Atomic Txs and Shared Memory
- Removed Multicoin Contract and State
- Removed DAO Hardfork Support

## Fuji Subnet Deployment
Ready to take the `subnet-evm` for a spin? Follow this
tutorial and you can get your own EVM on your own subnet
spun up on Fuji in a jiffy!

_You can find an example of a genesis file to use when launching your own
`subnet-evm` in the [networks folder](./networks/43214/genesis.json)._

### Prerequisites
* >= 1 node running on Fuji (does not need to be a validator)
* [`subnet-cli`](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-cli) installed
* `subnet-cli` private key with some Fuji AVAX (see [faucet](https://faucet.avax-test.network))

### Build Binary
First, you'll need to compile the subnet-evm into a binary that AvalancheGo
can interact with. To do this, run the following commands (assumes you don't
yet have the `subnet-evm` repository downloaded):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm.git;
cd subnet-evm;
./scripts/build.sh build/uaR2XyXqRP8CxYKEM63vt2fuAkPbXvhWpPEH3h2nfB14AS6LY
```

#### Move Binary
Once the `subnet-evm` binary is built, you'll need to move it to AvalancheGo's
plugin directory (within the `--build-dir`) so it can be run by your node.
When building from source, this defaults to `~/avalanchego/build/plugins`.
This build directory is structured as:
```
build-dir
|_avalanchego
    |_plugins
      |_evm
```

To put the `subnet-evm` binary in the right place, run the following command
(assuming the `avalanchego` and `subnet-evm` repos are in the same folder):
```bash
mv ./subnet-evm/build/uaR2XyXqRP8CxYKEM63vt2fuAkPbXvhWpPEH3h2nfB14AS6LY ./avalanchego/build/plugins;
```

### Run `subnet-cli wizard`
The easiest and fastest way to get your new subnet off the ground is to use the
[`subnet-cli`](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-cli). This powerful CLI can
add validators, create subnets, and create blockchains.

_The `subnet-cli` DOES NOT need to be run on the same host where you are
running your validator. By default, it interfaces exclusively with the public
Avalanche API Endpoints._

To make it as easy as possible to get started, the `subnet-cli` also provides
a `wizard` command that takes care of EVERYTHING for you. TL;DR, type one
command and you'll have a subnet with a running `subnet-evm` instance 5 minutes
later.

To make NodeID-XXXX a validator, create a subnet, add NodeID-XXXX to the
subnet, and create a `subnet-evm`-based blockhain, run the following command:

```bash
subnet-cli wizard \
--node-ids=NodeID-XXXX \
--vm-genesis-path=networks/43214/genesis.json \
--vm-id=uaR2XyXqRP8CxYKEM63vt2fuAkPbXvhWpPEH3h2nfB14AS6LY \
--chain-name=wagmi
```

_The `vm-id` was generated by calling `subnet-cli create VMID wagmi`. You can
use any value here...the only important thing is to make sure the binary you
generate has the same name._


#### Add New Subnet to Node Whitelist
During the execution of the `wizard` command, you will be prompted to add your
new subnetID to your node. This is done using the `whitelisted-subnets` config.
You can provide the `whitelisted-subnets` argument by modifying your config
file or providing an argument on startup.

Example Config File:
```json
{
  "network-id":"fuji",
  "health-check-frequency":"2s",
  "log-display-level":"INFO",
  "log-level":"INFO",
  "whitelisted-subnets":"<PROVIDED BY SPACES-CLI>"
}
```

Example Node Args:
```bash
--whitelisted-subnets=<PROVIDED BY SPACES CLI> --network-id=fuji
```

#### Restart Node
Once you've updated your config, you'll need to restart your
AvalancheGo node for the changes to take effect.

If you completed the steps successfully, you'll see the node print out:
